 I am a recent graduate from the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en) within the [College of Engineering](https://eng.ut.ac.ir/en) at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en),. I studyied Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Field and Wave (Communication). My supervisors are Professors [Mahmoud Shahabadi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahmoud-Shahabadi) and [Jalil Rashed-Mohassel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lAox-pUAAAAJ&hl=en), and I am a member of the Photonics Research Lab. My master's thesis was successfully defended entitled `Modal Analysis of Optical Integrated Waveguides in LiNbO3 Technology`.

Previously, I interned at the [Laboratory for Optics and Biosciences (LOB)](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lob/en), at the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) within the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en). I worked on nonlinear optics projects, specifically involving [`Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Modeling of Coherent Nonlinear Microscopy`](https://lob.ip-paris.fr/sites/lob/files/Stages-Th%C3%A8ses/FDTD_modeling_of_coherent_multiphoton_microscopy-Nicolas_OLIVIER-LOB-Palaiseau.pdf). Additionally, I gained experience in various programming languages, including C++, Python, and MATLAB, under the guidance of [Dr. Nicolas Olivier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ro9PnQAAAAJ&hl=en) [(NOLab)](https://nolab.github.io/Webpage/alumni.html).

I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree with 142 credits in Electrical Engineering (Communications). I also hold a Diploma in Education (Dip.Ed.) with 30 credits from [Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU)](https://www.sru.ac.ir/en/), which I completed in 2021. My undergraduate thesis focused on `Plane-Wave Reflection from a Grounded Slab of Complex Media`. During this research, I extracted formulas and performed simulations for complex materials, including `bi-anisotropic materials`, under the guidance of [Dr. S. Mohammad Hashemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SNoTWX8AAAAJ&hl=en).


My academic interests are:

- Optics & Photonics -> Nonlinear Optics & Photonic Integrated Circuits
- Quantum Photonics and Large-Scale Photonics -> Optical Interconnection Networks
- Theory of Machine Learning & Deep Learning -> Optical Neural Networks
