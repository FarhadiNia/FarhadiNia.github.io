I’m a Third Year Master’s student in the [School of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en) in [College of Engineering](https://eng.ut.ac.ir/en) at [University of Tehran](https://eng.ut.ac.ir/en), studying Electrical Engineering; and My Major is Fields & Wave (Communication). My Supervisors are [Prof. Mahmoud Shahabdi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahmoud-Shahabadi) and [Prof. Jalil Rashed-Mohassel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lAox-pUAAAAJ&hl=en), and I am a member of the Photonics Research Lab. 

I hold a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering (Communication) from [Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University (SRTTU)](https://www.sru.ac.ir/en/), which I completed in 2021. My undergraduate thesis focused on `Plane-Wave Reflection from a Grounded Slab of Complex Media`, where I extracted some formula & simulated for some Complex material with `Bi-Anisotropic materials` under the guidance of [Dr. S.Mohammad Hashemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SNoTWX8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Previously, I interned at [Laboratory of Optics and Bioscience (LOB)](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lob/en), in [École Polytecqunie](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) at [Institute Polytechne de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working on Nonlinear Opitcs projects. Other than that I gained experience in various technology involving CPP, Python, and Matlab under the guidance of [Dr. Nichloas Olivier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ro9PnQAAAAJ&hl=en) [(NOLab)](https://nolab.github.io/Webpage/alumni.html).

My academic interests are Nonlinear Optics, Integragted Photonics & Quantum Optics.
